# Backend Assignment
A django rest framework based web api's application that will be used by our candidates to implement interview assignment.

## Dependencies
This project relies mainly on Django. Mainly:
  - Python 3.8+
  - Django 3+ or 4+
  - Django Rest Framwork

## Requirements:
  - Candidates expected to implement required features for a library management system based on provided scenario
  - Candidates have to implement web REST api's for each required action related to scenario
  - Proper [JWT][1] based authentication should be implemented in each protected web apis
  - Ensure an user can only perform actions using apis which are allowed to the role assigned to that user

### Scenario
The are two roles in the system; `LIBRARIAN` and `MEMBER`

### As a User
  - I can signup either as `LIBRARIAN` and `MEMBER` using username and password
  - I can login using username and password

#### As a Librarian
  - I can add, update, and remove Books from the system
  - I can add, update, view, and remove Member from the system
  
#### As a Member
  - I can view, borrow, and return available Books
  - Once a book is borrowed, its status will change to `BORROWED`
  - Once a book is returned, its status will change to `AVAILABLE`
  - I can delete my own account

## Nice to Have:
It will be an advantage for candidates to demonstrate the following:
  - Proper usage of Http Methods and REST practices
  - Understanding of [SOLID Principle][2]
  - Understanding of Design patterns
  - Understanding of TDD and BDD
  - Each implementation should be equipped with unit tests
  - Integration tests are require to demonstrate API usages
